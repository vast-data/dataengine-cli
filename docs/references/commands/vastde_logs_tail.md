# vastde logs tail

Tail logs for a VAST DataEngine pipeline

## Synopsis

Stream live logs from a pipeline and its functions in real-time.

This command continuously streams new log entries as they are generated by pipeline executions.
Similar to 'tail -f' for files, it provides a live view of pipeline activity, making it ideal
for:

- Real-time monitoring during development
- Debugging active pipelines
- Observing function execution flow
- Tracking events as they occur

The command polls the telemetry system at regular intervals (default: 5 seconds) and displays
new log entries. Filtering options are the same as 'logs get':

- --function: Filter by specific function
- --severity: Filter by log level
- --scope: Filter by scope (user, runtime)
- --trace-id/--span-id: Filter by trace identifiers
- --interval: Polling interval (default: 5s)
- --limit: Initial number of historical logs to show (default: 100)

Press Ctrl+C to stop streaming. The tail command is particularly useful during pipeline
deployments and when testing function changes, as it provides immediate feedback on
execution behavior.

```
vastde logs tail <pipeline> [flags]
```

## Examples

```bash
  # Tail logs in real-time for a pipeline
  vastde logs tail data-processing-pipeline

  # Tail logs for a specific function
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --function image-processor

  # Tail only error logs
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --severity ERROR

  # Tail logs with custom polling interval (10 seconds)
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --interval 10s

  # Tail logs starting from a specific time
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --start "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"

  # Tail logs filtered by trace ID
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --trace-id abc123-def456

  # Tail logs with limit on entries per poll
  vastde logs tail my-pipeline --limit 50 --interval 5s
```
